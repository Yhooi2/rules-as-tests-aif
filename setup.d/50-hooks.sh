# GH #532: the shipped pre-push.ts is authored as an ES module, but its module-type is decided by
# the NEAREST package.json. In THIS repo packages/core/package.json declares "type":"module" (so the
# hook loads as ESM and runs); in a consumer the nearest package.json is usually the project root with
# no "type" → CJS default → tsx's `require(esm)` bridge hits Node ≥22 cycle detection and the hook dies
# with ERR_REQUIRE_CYCLE_MODULE *at module load*, before any §7/§1.7 check runs (every git push aborts
# with a stack trace). Ship a hooks-scoped {"type":"module"} marker so the shipped .ts loads as ESM —
# exactly as it does in this framework repo. Scoped to packages/core/hooks/ (AIF-owned) so it can't
# collide with a consumer's own packages/core package or be picked up as a workspace member.
