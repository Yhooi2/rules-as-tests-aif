# Automerge → staging integration plan

> **Status:** **LIVE** (staging-as-trunk, 2026-05-22). `staging` is the trunk + GitHub default branch — all work auto-merges into it via PR on green `ci-success`. `main` is prod-promotion-only (manual fast-forward; direct push blocked). `ci-success` is the sole required check on both. git-safety.sh push-block inverted (staging pushable, main blocked). **Merge queue: DEFERRED** — not configurable on this repo (REST API 422s on `merge_queue`; toggle absent in branch-protection + rulesets UI). The unattended-parallel-merge goal is met instead by disabling strict "require up-to-date" on `staging`; `main` stays strict + protected.
> **Authoritative for:** the automerge→staging operational plan — the branching flow (§2.1), decided shape, the maintainer GitHub-settings recipe (applied), and the open sub-decisions.
> **NOT authoritative for:** project goal — see [README.md#why-this-exists](../../README.md#why-this-exists). The CI-backstop mechanism it depends on — see [.claude/rules/no-paid-llm-in-ci.md](../../.claude/rules/no-paid-llm-in-ci.md) and the `pr-commit-trailers` job in [.github/workflows/audit-self.yml](../../.github/workflows/audit-self.yml).

## §1 Goal

The maintainer can leave the computer ~3 hours and PRs keep merging without him — into the permanent `staging` trunk via `gh pr merge --auto` on green `ci-success`, **not** `main`. The maintainer later promotes `staging → main` himself as a ship/no-ship **decision** (the "prod deploy") — explicitly NOT "human verifies the AI". The AI must have fully self-verified + re-tested everything before staging merge; the human click is a decision, not a QA pass.

> **Originally targeted GitHub Merge Queue** for serialisation (each PR tested against the future trunk's group ref before merge). However, Merge Queue is unavailable on this repo (REST API 422s on `merge_queue`; toggle absent in branch-protection + rulesets UI — DEFERRED). The unattended-parallel-merge goal is met instead by disabling strict "require up-to-date" (`strict:false`) on `staging`, so parallel `gh pr merge --auto` calls don't stall waiting for each other to merge first. Trade-off: no automatic test-against-future-trunk; content conflicts across parallel PRs must be prevented by file-scope partitioning (see §2.1).

## §2 Decided shape

- **Target:** sub-PRs auto-merge into the `staging` trunk via `gh pr merge --auto` on green `ci-success`. `staging` is the permanent default branch; `main` is prod-only.
- **Mechanism — variant A (native auto-merge, `strict:false`):** GitHub native auto-merge (`gh pr merge --auto`) gated on green `ci-success`. `strict:false` on `staging` means PRs are **not** required to be up-to-date before merging — so parallel `--auto` calls don't stall on each other. No LLM, no paid runtime → respects [no-paid-llm-in-ci.md](../../.claude/rules/no-paid-llm-in-ci.md). (Variant B = live-session preverify, weaker; variant C = autonomous paid agent, needs explicit policy exception — both rejected.) **Merge Queue variant originally preferred** (would test each PR against future trunk state) but is unavailable on this repo and DEFERRED (§1).
- **Human gate:** maintainer promotes `staging → main` manually (prod deployment decision).

## §2.1 Branching flow (the discipline)

```text
staging (permanent trunk, default branch) ──┐
   │  branch every feature/sub-PR FROM staging
   ▼
feature/* ──gh pr merge --auto on green ci-success──▶ staging
                                                        │  maintainer decides to ship
                                                        ▼  ── promotes staging → main (prod deploy)
                                                       main (prod snapshot)
```

**Always branch FROM `staging`, merge INTO `staging`.** This is the standard trunk-based development discipline:

- `staging` is the **permanent trunk** — the active integration branch holding all CI-verified work. `main` is the **prod snapshot** — a downstream release pointer that receives only from `staging` via manual promotion.
- Branching from `staging` anchors every PR to the latest verified work and prevents integration debt from piling up.
- `strict:false` on `staging` means each PR is **not** required to be up-to-date before merging — multiple parallel AI sessions can each call `gh pr merge --auto` on their respective PRs and they'll merge as soon as `ci-success` is green, without stalling on each other. (**Originally, Merge Queue was the preferred serialisation mechanism** — it auto-updates each PR against the live trunk and tests against the combined group ref — but it is unavailable on this repo and DEFERRED; `strict:false` is the substitute.)

**RESYNC is retired.** In the old model, a RESYNC step (`git push origin origin/main:staging`) was needed to prevent `staging` from becoming a divergent develop branch. In the new model, `main` is strictly downstream of `staging` — it only ever receives promotions FROM `staging`. `main` never leads `staging`. After a staging→main promotion, `main` ≈ `staging` (it is the ff from staging). No resync needed; no drift possible (main can never be ahead of staging).

**Everything routine goes through `staging` — including single small changes.** A PR straight to `main` requires a manual merge click (owner-only). A PR to `staging` auto-merges on green `ci-success` (zero clicks after `gh pr merge --auto`). The maintainer clicks once per batch at `staging → main`. Single small changes: use `staging` as the base and target.

**For overnight parallel AI sessions:**
```bash
# Each AI session:
git checkout -b feat/my-task origin/staging   # branch FROM staging (the trunk)
# ... make changes, commit ...
git push origin feat/my-task
gh pr create --base staging --head feat/my-task --title "..."
gh pr merge --auto --squash   # auto-merges when ci-success is green
```

Multiple sessions can call `gh pr merge --auto` simultaneously — `strict:false` means no stall.

### Parallel-sessions discipline (strict:false helps ordering, NOT content)

`strict:false` solves one failure mode for N parallel overnight sessions, but there are two distinct failure modes:

- **(a) Stale-base / ordering churn — SOLVED by `strict:false`.** With `strict:true`, every open PR goes out-of-date the moment another merges (→ manual `gh pr update-branch` + CI re-run per PR; with N sessions this thrashes and BLOCKS unattended — empirically reproduced: PR #140 returned "head branch is not up to date with the base"). `strict:false` eliminates this: each PR merges as soon as its own `ci-success` fires, no update required. (**Merge Queue would also solve this** — and additionally test each PR against the combined group ref — but it is DEFERRED. `strict:false` is the current substitute.)
- **(b) True content conflicts — NOT solved by any tool.** Two sessions editing the **same lines** produce a real conflict. No merge-bot auto-resolves semantic content conflicts.

**Therefore: the orchestrator dispatching N overnight sessions MUST partition their file scopes** — each session gets a **disjoint set of files** (the file-lock matrix), per [`parallel-subwave-isolation.md`](../../.claude/rules/parallel-subwave-isolation.md). `strict:false` + auto-merge gives "unattended, no ordering thrash"; **file-scope partitioning** gives "no rejected PRs from content conflicts". Both are required for the overnight-parallel goal.

**The `git-safety` hook (user-global `~/.claude/hooks/git-safety.sh`):**
- `git push origin staging` — **allowed** (staging is the trunk; pushing feature-branch setup tracking refs is the normal workflow)
- `git push origin main` — **blocked** (prod-only; promotion is via PR, maintainer-only)
- `gh pr merge --auto` on a `staging`-targeted PR — **allowed** (`:83` gate permits `base=staging`)
- `gh pr merge` on a `main`-targeted PR — **blocked for agents** (`:83` gate; `main` in `прочее`, maintainer-only)

## §3 Prerequisite status — CI-backstop (DONE)

The hard blocker was: §1.7 / Prior-art / test gates ran only in `.husky/pre-push`, so "CI green" ≠ "verified" until they were mirrored into CI deterministically. Closed:

| PR | What it added | State |
|---|---|---|
| **#121** | `pr-commit-trailers` job in [audit-self.yml](../../.github/workflows/audit-self.yml) — runs §1.7 + §7 over the real PR commit range via the `PREPUSH_ONLY` seam; §1.7 hard-enforced, §7 base blocks, §7 substance warn-only (Option B). | MERGED |
| **#123** | Parameterised the diff base via `PREPUSH_UPSTREAM_REF` so the backstop gates PRs targeting a **non-main base** (PRs → `staging`), not only `origin/main`. | MERGED |
| **#125** | Real `ci-success` aggregate job (`needs:` every audit-self PR job) so branch protection can require one context. | MERGED |
| **feat/staging-trunk-migration** | `merge_group` trigger in `audit-self.yml` (DAY-1 prerequisite for Merge Queue); push-trigger extensions to `staging`; R11 assertion repointed from `main` → `staging`; pre-push default refs flipped to `origin/staging`; this doc rewritten for new topology. | MERGED |

The CI backstop is already correctly parameterised to `origin/${{ github.base_ref }}` — so staging-targeted PRs are checked against `origin/staging` automatically. No additional backstop changes needed.

## §4 Phased plan

0. **CI-backstop** — DONE (§3).
1. **`staging` branch + branch protection + repo auto-merge** — DONE (2026-05-22, recipe §5).
2. **`merge_group` trigger + push-trigger extensions + R11 repoint** — DONE (feat/staging-trunk-migration, §3).
3. **Merge Queue enabled on `staging`** — **DEFERRED** (unavailable on this repo; REST API 422s on `merge_queue`; toggle absent in UI). Replaced by `strict:false` on `staging` (see §5 recipe — staging protection JSON uses `"strict": false`). The `merge_group` trigger in `audit-self.yml` was added in anticipation of eventual Merge Queue availability; it has no effect while queue is absent.
4. **Default-branch switch to `staging`** — **DONE** (2026-05-22; `staging` is now the GitHub default branch).
5. **Orchestrator flow (fully automated):** sub-PRs target `staging` (branched FROM `staging`, §2.1); AI sets `gh pr merge --auto <PR>`; auto-merge fires when `ci-success` is green; AI posts a plain-language report (what merged / what it verified / gaps & why).
6. **Decision gate:** maintainer reviews `staging` diff, promotes `staging → main` (prod deploy) manually.
7. **(Optional, later)** Automate `staging → main` once trust is established — higher blast radius (production), out of scope now.

## §5 Maintainer settings recipe (APPLIED 2026-05-22; updated for staging-as-trunk)

Reference for re-provisioning or emergency restore. `{owner}/{repo}` = `Yhooi2/rules-as-tests-aif`.

```bash
# 1. Ensure staging branch exists off the current trunk.
#    (If already exists: skip. If re-provisioning from scratch:)
git fetch origin && git branch staging origin/main && git push -u origin staging

# 2. Repo auto-merge (already enabled).
gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo} -F allow_auto_merge=true

# 3. Protect staging — permanent trunk. ci-success sole required context.
#    strict:false — PRs NOT required up-to-date; parallel gh pr merge --auto calls
#    don't stall each other (the strict:false substitute for Merge Queue ordering).
#    actionlint + zizmor aggregated under ci-success via needs: in audit-self.yml.
#    ATTN-B-1: add required_pull_request_reviews count=0 if maintainer opts for
#    defense-in-depth symmetry with former main protection. Below includes it.
gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/staging/protection --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": {"strict": false, "contexts": ["ci-success"]},
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {"required_approving_review_count": 0},
  "restrictions": null,
  "required_linear_history": false,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
JSON

# 4. Merge Queue on staging — DEFERRED (unavailable on this repo; REST API 422s;
#    toggle absent in Settings UI). strict:false (step 3 above) is the live substitute.
#    When/if Merge Queue becomes available: re-enable strict:true + add merge_group
#    settings here. The merge_group trigger already exists in audit-self.yml.

# 5. Protect main — prod-only; no direct commits; no Merge Queue.
gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": {"strict": true, "contexts": ["ci-success"]},
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {"required_approving_review_count": 0},
  "restrictions": null,
  "required_linear_history": false,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
JSON

# 6. Switch default branch to staging:
gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo} -f default_branch=staging
# Verify:
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '.default_branch'   # expected: staging
```

Per sub-PR (agent-side, while the maintainer is away):
```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-task origin/staging   # FROM staging (the trunk)
# ... changes ...
git push origin feat/my-task
gh pr create --base staging --head feat/my-task --title "..."
gh pr merge --auto --squash   # auto-merges when ci-success is green (strict:false, no stall)
```

Per staging→main promotion (maintainer, when ready to ship):
```bash
# Option A: PR-based promotion (recommended for audit trail)
gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head staging \
  --title "chore: promote staging → main (prod deployment)" \
  --body "Promoting staging trunk to main. All commits individually verified by CI on merge."
# Review the diff (this is the decision-click)
gh pr merge --squash   # or --merge for a merge commit

# Option B: direct fast-forward push (admin bypass, for simple ff promotions)
git push --force-with-lease origin staging:main
# Note: main protection (enforce_admins: false) allows admin bypass for promotion
```

## §6 Topology decision log (history preserved)

### §6.1 Old topology (2026-05-22 → before staging-as-trunk migration)

The project ran main-as-trunk from 2026-05-22 until the staging-trunk migration:
- `main` = source of truth (branches FROM main)
- `staging` = disposable review buffer (auto-merges from feature branches; maintainer promotes staging→main manually)
- RESYNC: `git push origin origin/main:staging` after each promotion (ff staging back to main)
- CI push triggers: `branches: [main, 'chore/**']`
- R11 assertion: asserted `ci-success` on `main`

### §6.2 New topology (staging-as-trunk migration; 2026-05-22+)

See §2.1 above. Key inversions from the old model:

| Property | Old (pre-migration) | New (post-migration) |
|---|---|---|
| Default/trunk branch | `main` | `staging` |
| Feature branch source | FROM `main` | FROM `staging` |
| Prod/release branch | `main` (dual role: trunk + release) | `main` (release-only) |
| Auto-merge mechanism | `gh pr merge --auto` (direct) | `gh pr merge --auto` on green `ci-success` (`strict:false`; Merge Queue DEFERRED) |
| Human action framing | Circuit-breaker merge | Prod-deploy decision |
| RESYNC discipline | Required (staging← main after promotion) | **Retired** (main only ff-from-staging) |
| CI push trigger | `branches: [main, 'chore/**']` | `branches: [staging, main, 'chore/**']` |
| R11 assertion target | `main` branch protection | `staging` branch protection |
| `merge_group` trigger | ABSENT | PRESENT in `audit-self.yml` |

### §6.3 Open sub-decisions (updated)

1. **Epic/ID-* flow in the new topology.** Feature and epic branches should now be cut FROM `staging` (not `main`). The git-safety.sh merge gate :83 already allows `base=staging` and `base=epic/ID-*`. Epic→staging continues to work. Orchestrator BASE_BRANCH discovery will find `staging` automatically. _(No code change needed; topology auto-corrects via discovery.)_
2. **Squash vs merge-commit** into staging — affects how `pr-commit-trailers` sees the range on the eventual `staging→main` PR. Squash recommended (one clean commit per sub-PR). _(Open — low stakes.)_
3. **README badge `?branch=main`** — three badges in README.md:4–6 still use `?branch=main`. After staging becomes the trunk, consider updating to `?branch=staging`. _(Maintainer decision — see ATTN-4 in migration runbook.)_
4. **`packages/core/templates/shared/integration-rules.md:31`** — "merge to main" consumer-facing phrase. Verify whether this refers to the consumer's own trunk (keep as-is) or should say "default branch". T-Migrate-A: do not auto-flip. _(Verify-with-maintainer — VM-01.)_
